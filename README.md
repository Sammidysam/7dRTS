=====

_**NOTE!** This project is now discontinued.  We were unable to finish the game in time to submit it, and now have changed repositories to develop it for fun.  To see the new repository, go [here](https://github.com/four04/for-the-glory-of-the-empire)._

A submission for Mini Ludum Dare 44: 7dRTS

There are some `.dll` files that must be packaged with the Windows executable for it to run.  A list is below.  When the game is done, a zip of the `.dll` files and the executable will be made by Sammidysam.  For Linux, a file containing the dependencies and the executable will be packaged in a tar file.  The archives will both contain the `img/` subdirectory so that images can be loaded as well.
- libglut0.dll
- libpng15-15.dll
- zlib1.dll
- libconfig-9.dll
