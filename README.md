A submission for Mini Ludum Dare 44: 7dRTS

There are some `.dll` files that must be packaged with the Windows executable for it to run.  A list is below.  When the game is done, a zip of the `.dll` files and the executable will be made by Sammidysam.  For Linux, a file containing the dependencies and the executable will be packaged in a tar file.  The archives will both contain the `img/` subdirectory so that images can be loaded as well.
- libglut0.dll
- libpng15-15.dll
- zlib1.dll
- libconfig-9.dll
