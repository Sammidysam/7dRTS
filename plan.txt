OLD PLAN BELOW
Open-ended
Grid
Teams placed at random-like locations
Teams can get settlers to get new territory
Armies remove settled state from territory
	Either die when doing so or take damage
Armies are naturally gained
Armies can be sped up with a loss of faith in nation by leader
	If too low, territory is given to a new nation
	
Therefore, needed are
	A list of nations
	A list of armies in each nation (2D list?)
	In army
		# of units
		health = # of units / max
		location
			Use 2D and 1D system
				1D to 2D
					x = pos / sqrt(tiles in board)
					y = pos % (int) sqrt(tiles in board)
				2D to 1D
					x * sqrt(tiles in board) + y
		Faith in leader
			When too low, can abandon nation and become barbarious

NEW PLAN BELOW

NOTE - drawing must be done dynamically to allow for resizing, if possible

Theme - Medieval

===Configuration Files
All numbers in here should be in a configuration file so that they can be easily edited.

===First, landscape of game
Nice sunny, looking happy grassland with some forests and lakes.
Typical background is around rgb(34, 139, 34) with some grass stuff
Castles take up 4 tiles at the start and can be expanded.  That can be either a 2x2 square or any other combination (randomly generate, but make sure when not a 2x2 that there are some environmental circumstances why e.g. lake nearby, forest nearby, hill nearby, etc.).  Castles are generally gray.  Maybe some special ones could be red, blue, green, etc.
Inside castles are little shops and outside are farms.
In the top right can be information about revolt risk, money, army size, etc.
In some tiles are lakes, which cannot be traversed.  Maybe later in the game boats could be unlocked through SCIENCE! (probably should be added once all else is done)
In some tiles are forests, which make units move twice as slow.
Sometimes there will be hills where there are three hill types: small, medium, and large.  Large could be considered mountains.  They bring down movement 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 respectively.

===Next, setup of game
N teams and some number of tiles that gives good spacing between nations.  Maybe 50 * N by 50 * N or something similar.  REALLY BIG.
Each team is given 4 castle tiles and 9 farm tiles at the start.
Farm tiles provide food.
Without food, citizens are more likely to revolt.  Farms can easily be destroyed by barbarians or other invaders, however.  Castle tiles can be taken relatively quickly if there is no wall on the tile.  Otherwise, the wall has to be breached somewhere or they have to come from a side without a wall.
Armies can be modified to select the amount of horsemen, archers, swordsman, etc. in them.  For example, you can make a scout force of purely horsemen and they will move faster.

===Goal of the Game
The goal of this game is what you make of it.  To sum it up nicely, "To make your empire make an impact of the world."  You can do so by having the happiest citizens, conquering a ton, etc.  Possible goals of the game (more memes?):
	My people are living the life
	I conquered everyone
	All your money are belong to us
	My castle is the biggest
	Best science ever

===General Play of the Game
Everything is happening in real time.  Armies spawn from inside the castle and can move around (but they need food when out).  The speed is determined by the people in the army.
Speed for units:
	Swordsman: 1 tile every 4 days
	Horseman/Knight: 1 tile every 2 days
	Trebuchet: 1 tile every 6 days
	Archer: 1 tile every 3 days
For armies:
	Average speed of all units in army
	
A "day" is about 15-30 seconds.  During which resources are gained.  It takes some army points to make an army.
Army can be of any size, so unit costs:
	Swordsman - 1 food, 1 stone
	Horseman - 2 food
	Knight - 2 food, 1 stone
	Trebuchet - 5 food, 14 wood
	Archer - 1 food, 1 wood
	
Armies hugely have to be built up for them to be good.  You cannot make a fully-fledged army in one day and expect results.  Armies require 1 food per day while outside the castle to stay alive.  You can send food with armies.  Once it hits zero, they will automatically head back to the castle, and if they are out for five days with no food they will desert and become barbarians.

Food is lost at a rate of 1 per castle tile.

======Building

Building farms costs ? food and they take ? days to grow.

Building new castle tiles costs ? army points and they take ? days to complete.

======Resources

Resources are stone, wood, and food.

======Citizen Disapproval

The citizen disapproval starts at 0 and increases when:
	Citizens do not eat (1 per day)
	Country is at war (0.5 per day)
	Army is too small (0.5 per day)
	Food surplus (-1 per day)
	Army is "just right" (-1 per day)
Citizen disapproval cannot go below 0.
	
Citizen disapproval affects just about everything.  It increases army and building costs, decreases army power, and many more things (expand list).

===Ideas
PUT COOL IDEAS HERE!

Maybe sqrt sign could be used for a check mark?
Art to make:
	Castle Textures:
		Up/down face castle wall (Sam's original tower.png is example)
		Faceaway castle wall
		Side castle wall facing left and facing right
		Castle floor tile for inside walls
		Some buildings (basically just custom roofs):
			Carpentry
			Houses
			Manor
			Barracks
			Market square
	Lake
	Grass
	Hill (NOT mountain)
	Texture Error
	Tree for Forest
	Army Textures:
		Swordsman
		Horseman (no armor)
		Knight (armor)
		Trebuchet
		Archer
