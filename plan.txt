OLD PLAN BELOW
Open-ended
Grid
Teams placed at random-like locations
Teams can get settlers to get new territory
Armies remove settled state from territory
	Either die when doing so or take damage
Armies are naturally gained
Armies can be sped up with a loss of faith in nation by leader
	If too low, territory is given to a new nation
	
Therefore, needed are
	A list of nations
	A list of armies in each nation (2D list?)
	In army
		# of units
		health = # of units / max
		location
			Use 2D and 1D system
				1D to 2D
					x = pos / sqrt(tiles in board)
					y = pos % (int) sqrt(tiles in board)
				2D to 1D
					x * sqrt(tiles in board) + y
		Faith in leader
			When too low, can abandon nation and become barbarious

NEW PLAN BELOW

NOTE - drawing must be done dynamically to allow for resizing, if possible

Theme - Medieval

===First, landscape of game
Nice sunny grassland with some forests and lakes.
Typical background is rgb(34, 139, 34) with some grass stuff
Castles take up 8 tiles.  That can be either one middle with the surrounding tiles or any other combination (randomly generate).  Castles are generally gray.  Maybe some special ones could be red, blue, green, etc.
Inside castles are little shops and outside are farms.
Outside castles are farms.
In the top right can be information about revolt risk, money, army size, etc.
In some tiles are lakes, which cannot be traversed.  Maybe later in the game boats could be unlocked.
In some tiles are forests, which make units move twice as slow.
Mountain ranges?  I don't think so.
Instead, sometimes there will be hills where there are three hill types: small, medium, and large.  Large could be considered mountains.  They bring down movement 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 respectively.

===Next, setup of game
N teams and some number of tiles that gives good spacing between nations.  Maybe 50 * N by 50 * N or something similar.  REALLY BIG.
Each team is given 8 castle tiles and 8 farm tiles.
Farm tiles give food to the citizens, castle tiles allow creation of armies faster.
Armies can be modified to select the amount of horsemen, archers, swordsman, etc. in them.  For example, you can make a scout force of purely horsemen and they will move faster.

===Ideas
Maybe bring castle tiles at start down to four?

Art to make:
	Up/down castle wall
	Faceaway castle wall
	Lake
	Army - humans, knights, trebuchets,
