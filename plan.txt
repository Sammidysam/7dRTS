Open-ended
Grid
Teams placed at random-like locations
Teams can get settlers to get new territory
Armies remove settled state from territory
	Either die when doing so or take damage
Armies are naturally gained
Armies can be sped up with a loss of faith in nation by leader
	If too low, territory is given to a new nation
	
Therefore, needed are
	A list of nations
	A list of armies in each nation (2D list?)
	In army
		# of units
		health = # of units / max
		location
			Use 2D and 1D system
				1D to 2D
					x = pos / sqrt(tiles in board)
					y = pos % (int) sqrt(tiles in board)
				2D to 1D
					x * sqrt(tiles in board) + y
		Faith in leader
			When too low, can abandon nation and become barbarious
